# Math Diet

This repository contains the source code for my exam project in the 4. semester android elective at KEA's computer science course. 
For this assignment I chose to create an app which aims to simplify the usage of a new weight loss method recently developed by danish professor, Jakob Stoustrup, called "Mathmatical Weightloss". For more info on method and how it works, check the link below:

## Noteworthy implementations
### Data storage:
https://www.sqlite.org/index.html  
A versatile, self-contained and powerful relational SQLdatabase engine, embedded directly into the app.

### Graphs for data display:
https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart  
A third party tool designed to allow for data graphs in android apps.

## Install instructions

Simply clone the repository and open the cloned folder in Android Studio. Once opened you can run the project.
