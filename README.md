# Math Diet

This repository contains the source code for my exam project in the 4. semester android elective at KEA's computer science course. 
For this assignment I chose to create an app which aims to simplify the usage of a new weight loss method recently developed by danish professor, Jakob Stoustrup, called "Mathmatical Weightloss". For more info on method and how it works, check the link below:

A versatile, self-contained and powerful relational SQLdatabase engine, embedded directly into the app.
